# #### Imoporting the Necessary Library 

# # NLP model to taking care of Text Messages 

# # Building The ML Model 

# # Let's Try Predoicting with the Naive Bayes Algo

# # We can say that Naive Bayes has better prediction than Logistic Regression Logistic Regression Prediction model = 0.9838565022421525 And Naive Bayes = 0.9847533632286996

# ### Let's Visualize the Confusion Matrix
